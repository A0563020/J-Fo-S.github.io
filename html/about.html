                    Professionally, I have worked in various roles in politics, governmental organizations, international mining projects, and education. </br>
                    </br>

                    I currently teach Web Design and Applications in Technology at Shih Chien University (as of 2018). I also give workshops in creative coding and programming, and occasionally topics from previous experience in international relations. </br>
                    </br>

                    Previously I was the Content and Technical Director for a creative coding and programming academy called Skyrock Projects. </br>
                    </br>

                    My interests span a wide spectrum of the arts, politics and natural (as in nature) activities. I hope I can express them in my work. </br>
