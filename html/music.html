                    <p class="font1">Insequel is a work of structured improvisation and performance for computer music, and was performed on August 24th, 2017 at the Osmosis Festival in Taipei, for which the piece was conceived, composed and programmed for. It was an opportunity to both advance and humble my concerns with digital and computer music’s general treatments, due to technological and cultural factors, of rhythm, harmony, and ‘pure sound’. I say “advance” and “humble” with equal importance to the latter, as my concerns with typical treatments of rhythm especially had caused me previously to almost entirely ignore not rhythm itself, but “beats” and sequencing. I believed, and still do, that digital music, in its popular technological forms of software sequencing and cultural forms of style, has automated beat and rhythm to a point that they have often become rote and lifeless commodities.. (and on and on). 

                    I decided Insequel would be the composition and performance to ease the “ban” on beat sequencing while trying to add some life, evolution and interplay to the method. Ironically, though not surprisingly, the results are a rough, even crude, mixture of intention and teething. The name itself is also part of the structure - everything that happens is stretched out over the duration of the performance. One very tight sequence (1 second) is introduced and ultimately expanded into a longer sequence (24 seconds). And thus the entire performance is essentially only one sequence.</p>

                    This was an album made in Manizales, Colombia circa 2011 and then obsessively and naively - yet intuitively - edited by me when I was banished to China in 2012. 'Twas from a very different time that feels surreal now.
