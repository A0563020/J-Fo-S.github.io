                     Straight=>Curve is a visual companion for live musical performance. It was developed to go alongside computer music performances, but can conceivably be used in combination with any audio input or performance, including acoustic instruments. As a visual performance component, it is intended almost purely (if this possible) as aesthetics, and is not intended as a standalone piece. As the name Straight=>Curve suggests, the ‘point’ is about curvature, and bringing what is straight (lines, shapes, one’s thinking, direction in life, etc.) into a curve that is recognizable as interesting, or beautiful, on its own and in its form with its surroundings.

                    p5.js is a fun little (big?) JavaScript interpretation of its currently more famous older sibling, Processing. I use p5.js for teaching students and myself anything from working with shapes and geometries to simulations and works with computer vision. p5.js has performance limitations for works of larger scale, but it does have a nice niche.
