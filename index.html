                    <p class="font1">This site has been put up after a bout of realization that, as you surely know, no one will believe that you can do anything unless you have a website and a pocketful of social media profiles where you blather and take pictures of your lunch and protest everything except yourself and hash tag every cliche you can think of and cross link to all of your profiles in hope that someone will bite through all these crinkly wrappers to your little literal morsel and read your content that you will have already forgotten about and in a former life you never would have wanted to put up in the first place. Which they probably won't, so here is mine: if you read this far I should have put some emojis in and followed the instructions above but it's 2am and I haven't figured out how to do it yet so the best I can offer is an over-saturated perspective of the sun from a picture my phone took on its own by accident(?) which I really enjoyed despite all of this  - click your mouse and hope you enjoy too!</p>


                    <h2 id="badger1">Interests and Professional Experience</h2>
                    <p class="font1">
                    Professionally, I have worked in various roles in politics, governmental organizations, international mining projects, and education. I now am the Content and Technical Director for a creative coding and programming academy that serves high school students and adults. I enjoy education a great deal when it is sincere and authentic - helping someone towards the state of becoming. Beyond professionalism, my interests span a wide spectrum of the arts, politics and natural (as in nature) activities. For what it is worth, my politics are generally geared towards awareness, objectivity, vision, pragmatics and empathy. I value reality, knowing uncertainty with certainty, and relativity over any of the party or idealist trappings. I hope I can express this more potently in my work.
