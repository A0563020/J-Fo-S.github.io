                    Professionally, I have worked in various roles in politics, governmental organizations, international mining projects, and education. I now am (as of 2017) the Content and Technical Director for a creative coding and programming academy that serves high school students and adults. My interests span a wide spectrum of the arts, politics and natural (as in nature) activities. I hope I can express them in my work.
