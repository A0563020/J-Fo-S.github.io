                    <p class="font1">This site has been put up after a bout of realization that, as you surely know, no one will believe that you can do anything unless you have a website and five or more additional social media profiles where you blather and take pictures of your lunch and protest everything except yourself and hash tag every cliche you can think of and cross link to all of your profiles in hope that someone will bite through all these crinkly wrappers to your little literal morsel and read your content that you will have already forgotten about and in a former life you never would have wanted to put up in the first place. Which they probably won't, so here is mine: if you read this far I should have put some emojis in and followed the instructions above but it's 2am and I haven't figured out how to do it yet so the best I can offer is an over-saturated perspective of the sun from a picture my phone took on its own by accident(?) which I really enjoyed despite all of this  - click your mouse and hope you enjoy too!</p>
